1.Disturbuted System .
2.Design Pattern.------ Design problem " Publisher Suscriber Model".
3. Live Streaming system 

@Requirement for a Live Streaming Application :
1.Streaming Video.
2.Processing Video.
3.Braodcasting.
4.Failproof.
5.Advertisement. 
6.Reaction .
7.Disclaimers/News Flasher .
8.Degradation of videa quality. 
9.Multiple Device Support.

Simple Diagfram for the required system ::


                               ---API---                                      ---API---
(Customer)----------------------------{Server}-------------------------[Database]

 
4. Network Protocal use in the system is HTTP which is a stateless protocal and we can     also use a protocal that only used for Streaming video named as "RTMP Proctocal" or "WEBRTC".

5. WHich database solution should used ?
Ans: We can use file system insated of database , HDTS or Amazon S3.

6. Entire Raw video should be converted to different resolution.?
                      
7. Content Delivery Network.?How does HTTP-Dash work Internelly?

@Important things to notice ::
1. Define the requirement as abstract concept(Object).
2. Object can be manipulated and queried using API's on server.
3. Data representation need to be in databases.

@What are the action that a user can perform? (Low Level Design)
-Timestamp [X]
-Pause the video/Last seek point.
- Adaptive video quality.
- Last Watch seek position.

@Things to be consider for the videa streaming app.
-Memort Optimization.
-User Behaviour.
-API Calling.
